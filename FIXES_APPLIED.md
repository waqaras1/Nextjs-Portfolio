# 🔧 Fixes Applied to Next.js Portfolio Project

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 1. **Metadata Configuration Warnings** - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: `viewport` and `themeColor` were configured in the `metadata` export instead of a separate `viewport` export, causing Next.js 15 warnings.

**Solution**: 
- Moved `viewport` and `themeColor` from `metadata` export to a separate `viewport` export
- Updated `app/layout.tsx` to follow Next.js 15 standards

**Files Modified**:
- `app/layout.tsx` - Separated viewport configuration

### 2. **Missing Video Poster** - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: Layout referenced `/video-poster.jpg` which doesn't exist in the public directory.

**Solution**: 
- Removed the `poster` attribute from the video element
- Video will now start playing immediately without a poster image

**Files Modified**:
- `app/layout.tsx` - Removed poster reference

### 3. **Webpack Configuration Warning** - FIXED ✅
**Problem**: Project uses Turbopack but has webpack configuration that may cause conflicts.

**Solution**: 
- Added `webpack: undefined` to explicitly disable webpack config for Turbopack
- Updated `next.config.ts` for better Turbopack compatibility

**Files Modified**:
- `next.config.ts` - Added Turbopack compatibility

### 4. **Environment Variables Documentation** - ADDED ✅
**Problem**: No clear documentation for setting up email functionality.

**Solution**: 
- Added environment variables section to README.md
- Included instructions for Gmail App Password setup
- Added step-by-step configuration guide

**Files Modified**:
- `README.md` - Added environment setup documentation
